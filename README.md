# Itemized

*Itemized* will be an application to create lists of items with a free hierarchical structure. There are several use cases for such an application: 

- gather your thoughts and ideas and bring them in a structure that fits your needs
- use it as a task management system or Todo app
- plan the outline of documents and presentations
- shopping list 


## Goals

The project has multiple goals that give you an idea of the intent of the project. 

- great usability
- freedom in the way you structure your data
- privacy: you have control of your data


## Technical Details

The *Itemized* project will consist multiple parts:

- Mobile apps for Android and iOS
- Web application for usage in modern Webbrowsers
- Desktop application
- A server application

All client apps are designed to be able to work completely offline without any server interaction. However, there will also be a server application that enables several extra features like "cloud persistence" of data, synchronization between devices and collaborative work with team members. 
We are planing to provide a central server as a service but it will also be possible to host your own server. This way you have full control of your data.
